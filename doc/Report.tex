\subsection{Main Models}
\begin{description}
\item[Student:]
Student Model has all the basic information about the student including his
personal information. It maintains relationship with department, academic
information, registration form and template models to capture the properties
related to a student.
\item[Faculty]
Faculty Model does the same task as the student model but for faculty. It has
relationship with offered courses and departmennt. We have allowed a faculty
to take as amny courses and a course can be taken by more than one faculty.
\item[Department]
Department model is used just to keep track of existing departments. It is
linked to all the models which have the concept of department.
\item[Academic Information]
Academic information model keeps track of past performances of a student. It
is used to generate the transcript and calculate performace index (cpi,spi
etc). When an instructor submits the grade the information is moved to this
model.
\item[Course]
Course model consist of all the courses that are offered till now in the
history of the institute.
\item[Offered Course]
Offered courses are the actual courses that are offered next semester. So a
student can request courses to take in next semester only for these
courses. Offered courses are linked to courses to preserve one to one
relationship between them.
\item[Lecture Time]
Lecture time captures the weekly schedule of the offered courses. It enables
us to automatically detect timetable clashes and also generate timetable
for the offered courses taken by the student.
\item[Registration Form]
Registration form keeps track of the pre-registration. A student can add or
delete courses to this form and then submit it to DUGC for verification. It is
also used to see what all courses the student is taking this semester so to
enable a faculty to submit grades for the students.
\item[Template]
Template is used by any priviledged person to create a semester template
constraint for a student or a group of students. We can create compulsory as
well as bucket courses to be taken by a student in a particular semester and
this constraint will be checked when the student submits his pre registration
form.

\section{Agile Software Development}
We developed our OARS using iterartive and incremental development based on the developed test cases prior to the development of actual code. We designed automated test cases for every unit (class) that needs to be added for our functionalities, than the developed code was tested upon the test cases, if the test cases passes we would combine the new unit with our previous model and continue with the same process for futher development, else we would rectify our problem and iterate the whole preocess again. The test cases were written. We wrote our test cases using \emph{Cucumber} which is a tool to run test cases in ruby, written in \emph{BDD}  Behavior Driven Development style. Each test case consist of a feature and multiple scenarios, where feature defines the testing area and scenarios defines the multiple paths which the test case could take. The whole test-case consists of two files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Feature File}: This is a normal file written with BDD style (close to Natural Language) which contains basically three commands \emph{Given},\emph{When} and \emph{Then} which defines the complete scenario.
\item \emph{Step Defination}: This file contains the actual code that needs to be run while going through the steps mentioned in the feature file. The steps in the feature file act as a regular expression in the feature definations and the code written in the function defination gets executed while cucumber parses to the feature file. Basically what it does is that it visits throuhout the application checking the correctness in terms of the view(output) of the application, by browsing though the \emph{HTML} code, filling input values and navigating from one location to another in the application. The step definitions are written in Ruby. This gives much flexibility on how the test steps are executed. It can use an already exisiting step definitions for a given step if you need the same step for checking some other functionality.
\end{itemize} 
These type of tests should be run during the implementation phase as well as later on when the site is fully functional. Even if the test was created during the implementation phase, it should still be run every time with every new release that goes out. It can even be used as a part of a stand-alone test set for the site. This helps in reducing our effort by huge amount as fas as testing is considered. We wrote feature files to test accross all our units, which carried out steps to navigate through our system through the outside views, i.e. they basically tested our units through \emph{Black Box Testing}. Then we wrote test cases for integration testing i.e. to check whether the units are interacting properly or not. For special cases like cpi,spi calculation: we wrote special test cases (on function level) to verify their functionality. This whole testing and code process helped us in saving time and debugging our code. Also, it helped in removing the manual testing of our software which needs to be done in any case.\\
Maintaining any software and test automation will definitly benefit from good development process.So we used git as our version control system. It will enable us in maintaining the current version of the automation and also in tracking the changes done to it and also to revert back to an earlier state if we get stuck into a problem.
